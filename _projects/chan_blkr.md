A project for the Fields & Waves course, the aim was to use Maxwell derived transmission line equations to design a 
coaxial cable stub that would act as a short under a specified frequency. 

The team first picked a low and a high cable channel to block, found the frequencies they were broadcasted on, and 
finally calculated the necessary stub lengths to block the desired frequencies. After simulating the stub in LTSpice, 
the cables were cut to their specified lengths, tested on a spectrum analyzer, and then on a television. 

The stubs were successful in blocking both channels and demonstrated important physics principles.
