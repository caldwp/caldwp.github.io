I've always had an aptitude for math and a love for science and technology, so engineering was an obvious career path for me. My first exposure started at the end of high school, with Java programming courses and a Principles of Engineering class. These classes taught me how I could apply my knowledge from other subjects and use my creativity to solve problems. I knew I wanted to learn more, and in 2019 I was accepted into Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in Troy, New York.

Going to school at RPI was the hardest thing I've done to date, but was by far the most gratifying. I started as a Computer & Systems Engineering major, with the opportunity to learn about system architecture, software, electromagnetics, circuits and so much more. I worked on several projects, each one motivating me to keep learning and giving me a better understanding of their respective subjects. In my final year, I developed an interest in robotics and autonomous systems and picked up a dual major in Electrical Engineering. I graduated Magna Cum Laude in May of 2023.

Currently, I work as a Software Engineer on training systems for Lockheed Martin RMS. I'm constantly learning in this role, but it is my dream to work in space exploration, robotics, or ideally both. It's my goal to eventually lead R&D projects, and I plan on achieving this either through getting a research degree or finding opportunities at work. Please, feel free to get in contact with me if you think I could benefit your team!
