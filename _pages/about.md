Since I was little, I have loved to learn. Naturally, this turned to a love for the subject that produced knowledge, the sciences. I knew early on that I wanted to pursue this vast subject as a career, and this eventually led me to engineering, where science is applied.

Being enamored by space exploration and having an aptitude for math, I first decided to enroll at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute as an Aerospace Engineering major. I quickly switched to Computer & Systems Engineering after deciding I liked programming too much, and picked up an Electrical Engineering dual later on. Towards the end of my Bachellor's program, I became inspired by Robotics and Smart Systems, which I plan on going to graduate school to study.

It is my ambition to eventually lead research in Autonomous Systems. Whether this is done through getting a research degree or gaining industry experience, it is my goal to become part of the scientific research that motivated me down this path from the start.
